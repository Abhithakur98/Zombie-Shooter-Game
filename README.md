Created a Zombie Survival Shooting Game in Visual Studio using C#

Made a top down style zombie shooter survival game. The main object of this game is to shoot as many zombies as possible and survive. The player has a health bar which can deplete if the zombies touch you and you can shoot in all 4 directions and collect ammo when it runs out. Zombies will mindlessly follow you in the game and just make sure you keep them off you. 

Made this game fully inside of Visual Studio with Windows form components and C# programming language. Went through some critical game development methods such as events, player actions, dynamically creating objects in windows form and removing them when we don't need them in the game.
